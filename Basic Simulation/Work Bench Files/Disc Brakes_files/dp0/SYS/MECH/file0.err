/COM,ANSYS RELEASE Release 18.1      BUILD 18.1      UP20170403       18:35:20

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       8.500   TIME= 18:35:26
 Using 1 iteration per substep may result in unconverged solutions for   
 nonlinear analysis and the program may not indicate divergence in this  
 case.  Check your results.                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      11.047   TIME= 18:35:28
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      18.703   TIME= 18:35:34
 Material number 8 (used by element 19049761 ) should normally have at   
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      44.719   TIME= 18:35:56
 Too many nodes 6446 are included in the force-distributed-surface       
 constraint identified by real constant set 10.  This may greatly        
 affect solver performance due to large wave fronts and memory           
 consumption.  Also check results carefully and consider solving with a  
 different unit system.
